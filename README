portage-env-mv:

This is Martin VÃ¤th's local /etc/portage/env and /etc/portage/package.cflags
for gentoo, full of local fixes and hacks

It is mainly meant for personal use, but it is under the GPL v2 license.
You can include local files into */local; these are not under git control.

The package.cflags subdirectory is meant to be used through portage-bashrc-mv
	https://github.com/vaeth/portage-bashrc-mv/
An ebuild for the latter is in the mv overlay (available over layman).

The login picture for slim should be provided this way in
	/etc/portage/env/local/pic/login.jpg
(either the */pic or the */login.jpg can be a symlink which is resolved).

Moreover, some patches should be provided this way either in
	/etc/portage/env/local/patches
	/etc/portage/env/patches/local
	$MV_PATCHES
