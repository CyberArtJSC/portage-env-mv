# mv prefers green cursor over of blinking chinese water torture:
# This patch is required for linux terminals and tmux/emacs/vi
# You still have to printf '\033[?17;0;168c' in shell startup and /etc/issue
# Without this patch, see https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CursorOnLinuxConsole
# (use locally infocmp linux >1, edit end of cnorm and cvvis and "tic 1")
